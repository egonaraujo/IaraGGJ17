Iara is a game made for Global Game Jam 17 where the theme was Waves

# Engine

Game was developed using Unity 5.5.0f3

# Gameplay

We used the diversifier `Spaced`, where the only button you ever use is the Spacebar

So the gameplay works by simply tapping or holding spacebar

* Tap to change menu items
* Hold to select them

In Game

* Hold to move the selection
* Release to select the note
  * Release on a wrong note and you have a delay before pressing again
  * Release on a correct one and the related boat gets a hit
* Hit all colors of a boat to bring it down
